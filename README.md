# Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction

This project focuses on cleaning and performing EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passangers and their survival rates.


## Project Steps

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, transforming data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Univariate analysis: Understanding the distributions of individual variable such as age, and survival status. 
- Bivariate Analysis: Assessing relationships between two variables such as age  and fare. 
- Multivariate Analysis: Examining patterns involving multiole variables such as age, fare, andsurvival status using advanced visualizations such as facet grid.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigating numerical relationships to reveal significant associations between features.

## Project Insights
  - Missing values in key columns such as age were adress through data cleaning.
   - Observed that gender, and ticket class significantly influence   survival rates.
   - Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) had higher survival rates compared to lower classes.
